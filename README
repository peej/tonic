PHP library/framework for building Web apps while respecting the 5 principles
of RESTful design.

 * Give every "thing" an ID (aka URIs)
 * Link things together (HATEOAS)
 * Use standard methods (aka the standard interface)
 * Resources with multiple representations (aka standard document formats)
 * Communicate statelessly

See http://peej.github.com/tonic/ for more info.


How it works
------------

Everything is a resource, and a resource is defined as a PHP class. An annotation
wires a URI (or a collection of URIs) to the resource, and methods that match
the HTTP methods by name allow interaction with it.


/**
 * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
 * @uri /example
 */
class ExampleResource extends Resource { }


The incoming HTTP request is turned into a list of negotiated URIs based on the
accept request headers which can then be used to pick the best representation
for the response.


/**
 * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
 * @uri /example
 */
class ExampleResource extends Resource {
    
    function get($request) {
        
        $response = new Response($request);
        
        $response->code = Response::OK;
        $response->body = 'Example response';
        
        return $response;
        
    }
  
}

and then resources/example.php
