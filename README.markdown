PHP library/framework for building Web apps while respecting the 5 principles
of RESTful design.

 * Give every "thing" an ID (aka URIs)
 * Link things together (HATEOAS)
 * Use standard methods (aka the standard interface)
 * Resources with multiple representations (aka standard document formats)
 * Communicate statelessly

[See the Tonic site for more info](http://peej.github.com/tonic/).


How it works
============

Everything is a resource, and a resource is defined as a PHP class. An annotation
wires a URI (or a collection of URIs) to the resource, and methods that match
the HTTP methods by name allow interaction with it.

    /**
     * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
     * @uri /example
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource { }

The incoming HTTP request is turned into a list of negotiated URIs based on the
accept request headers which can then be used to pick the best representation
for the response.

    /**
     * This class defines an example resource that is wired into the URI /example
     * @uri /example
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource {

        function get($request) {

            $response = new Response($request);

            $response->code = Response::OK;
            $response->body = 'Example response';

            return $response;

        }

    }


How to get started
==================

The best place to get started is to get the hello world example running on your
system, to do this you will need a web server running PHP5.1+.

Place all of the Tonic files into your PHP include path so that other scripts can
find it. By default on Windows this will probably be in "c:\php\includes\tonic" or
on Linux/Unix it will be "/usr/share/php/tonic"

Copy "docroot/dispatch.php" into your servers document root and edit it so that the
require_once statement paths point to the Tonic library and the examples.

Finally you need to route all incoming requests to dispatch.php. How you do this
depends on your web server. If you are using Apache, the simplest way is to copy
the .htaccess file from "docroot/.htaccess" into your Apache document root.


Features
========


Request URI
-----------

The URI that is processed for the request when you create the Tonic Request object
is gather by default from the REQUEST_URI Apache variable. If you need to gather
the URI from another $_SERVER variable or somewhere else then you can pass it into
the Request objects constructor as a configuration option:

    $request = new Request(array(
        'uri' => $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']
    ));


Base URI
--------

If you want to put your Tonic dispatcher at a URL that isn't the root of a domain
then you'll need to let the Request object know so that the @uri annotations ignore
it:

    $request = new Request(array(
        'baseUri' => '/some/base/uri'
    ));

Don't put a trailing slash on the end.


URI annotations
---------------

Resources are attached to their URL by their @uri annotation:

    /**
     * @uri /example
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource { }

As well as a straight forward URI string, you can also use a regular expression
so that a resource is tied to a range of URIs:

    /**
     * @uri /example/([a-z]+)
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource {
        function get($request, $parameter) {
            ...
        }
    }

URL template and Rails route style @uri annotations are also supported:

    /**
     * @uri /users/{username}
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource {
        function get($request, $username) {
            ...
        }
    }

    /**
     * @uri /users/:username
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource {
        function get($request, $username) {
            ...
        }
    }

It is also possible for multiple resource to match the same URI, so you can
prioritise which resource should be used by specifying a priority level as part
of the annotation:

    /**
     * @uri /example/([a-z]+)
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource { }

    /**
     * @uri /example/apple 2
     */
    class ExampleResource extends Resource { }

By postfixing the @uri annotation with a number, of all the matching resources,
the one with the highest postfixed number will be used.


Mimetypes
---------

To handle content negotiation via filename style extensions to URLs as well the
HTTP Accept header, a mapping between extensions and mimetypes can be provided.
By default this list contains a number of common mappings, if you need to add one
or more of your own, pass them into the constructor as an array:

    $request = new Request(array(
        'mimetypes' => array(
            'ogv' => 'video/ogg'
        )
    ));


Mount points
------------

To make resources more portable, it is possible to "mount" them into your URL-space
by providing a namespace name to URL-space mapping. Every resource within that
namespace will in effect have the URL-space prefixed to their @uri annotation.

    $request = new Request(array(
        'mount' => array(
            'namespaceName' => '/some/mounted/uri'
        )
    ));

Again, don't put a trailing slash on the end, and if you aren't using PHP5.3 and
namespaces, you can use the @namespace annotation.


Response exceptions
-------------------

The Request object and Resource objects can throw ResponseExceptions when a problem
occurs that the object does not want to handle and so relinquishes control back
to the dispatcher.

The ResponseException has its code value set to the HTTP response code of the problem
and its message set to a human readable reason for throwing the exception. The
ResponseException::response() method can be used to produce a default Response object
expressing the exception if required.

The Request object throws a 404 ResponseException when the resource to be loaded
does not exist.

The Resource object throws a 405 ResponseException when the HTTP method from the
request is not able to be handled by the resource.

If you don't want to handle a problem within your Resource class, you can throw your
own ResponseException and handle it in the dispatcher. Look at the auth example for
an example of how.


Autoloading classes
-------------------

If you've got lots of resource classes and don't fancy including them all in your
dispatcher, you can use the autoload function to load a resource class for a given
URL-space.

    $request = new Request(array(
        'autoload' => array(
            '/example/[a-z]+' => 'ClassName'
        )
    ));

In this example, the class ClassName will be autoloaded via [the standard PHP
__autoload method](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php).



For more information, read the code. Start with the dispatcher "docroot/dispatch.php"
and then the examples in the "examples" directory.
