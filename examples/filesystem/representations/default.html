        <p>Welcome to the filesystem example.</p>
        <p>The resource "FilesystemResource" in filesystem.php is wired to any URI starting /filesystem and then maps the remaining part of the URI to the filenames on the filesystem within "examples/filesystem/representations".</p>
        <p>This page is being read from "examples/filesystem/default.html" on the filesystem as it is the default document
        for the current URL. <a href="filesystem/default.html">You'll also be able to see it at this URL</a>.</p>
        <p>The FilesystemResource also allows updating of the files by sending PUT and DELETE requests to their mapped URI.</p>
        <p>The resource "FilesystemCollection" in filesystemcollection.php
        <p><a href="filesystem/collection">View a collection resource for the directory "examples/filesystem/representations/collection"</a>.</p>
        <p>The FilesystemCollection also allows adding of a file to the collection by sending a POST request to the collection URI.</p>
